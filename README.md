# Network-Scanner

*==> Goal*

I have chosen to create this program in PowerShell to develop my skills in the PowerShell scripting language while finding it useful for my BUT Networks and Telecommunications, specializing in cybersecurity.

The program thus allows scanning a network by specifying a network address and a mask. You can also specify the processor capacity to allocate for this program.
